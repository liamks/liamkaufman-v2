After 3 years without change, I&#39;ve redone my personal website using Jekyll and Bootstrap. The previous version of liamkaufman.com was hosted on Google App Engine and consisted of a very basic CMS that I made before I knew what I was doing. I was both unhappy with the look of the site, and the code behind it. At the same time I was interested in using Jekyll, as I wanted to avoid the hassles associated with database backed sites. I also appreciate the fact that my site, and it’s content are easy to deploy and update via Github.
