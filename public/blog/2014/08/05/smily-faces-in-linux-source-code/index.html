  Github uses Linguist, a Ruby library, to help detect which programming language is in a given file. Recently, an issue was filed that indicated that Linguist incorrectly classifies Mercury (a programming language) files as Objective-c since they both use the same extension (.m). Linguist’s primary method for language detection is a file’s extension - a method that fell short for Mercury. If Mercury were added to Linguist, then there would be two languages with the same extension - and this is where things get interesting. If two languages share the same extension, or the file does not have an extension, Linguist has 3 methods for guessing the language. First it checks if the file has a shebang (#!/bin/sh). If there is no shebang the second method it uses is a set of heuristics. For instance, if the file includes the “:-” token it concludes that the contents are prologue code, or if “defun” is present it’s common lisp. If it still hasn’t found a match the third method it uses is a Bayesian classifier. Roughly speaking the classifier iterates over all of a file’s tokens, and for each token determines the probability that it is present in each programming language. Subsequently, it sums all those probabilities, sorts the results, and returns an array of language-probability pairs (e.g [[‘Ruby’, 0.8], [‘Python’, 0.2]]).
