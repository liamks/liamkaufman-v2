<p>
  With the public release of <a href="http://emberjs.com">ember.js</a>,
  I excitedly poured over the examples hoping to find a framework that 
  would make Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting (CRUD) easier. When
  push comes to shove, the vast majority of apps that I've worked on
  involve CRUD. 
</p>

<p>
  I want to see the following (excuse the pseudo code):<br />
``` javascript Model
model({
  validation: function(m){...}
});
```

``` javascript Controller
controller({
  show: function(){...},

  index: function(){...},

  new: function(){...},

  create: function(){...},

  ...

});
```

``` html Form
<form action=''>
  <input type='text' name='firstName'>
  <input type='submit' value='submit'>
</form>
```
</p>

<p>
  Will your framework help me 1) write less code, 2) get things done
  faster and 3) with less errors? Show me.
</p>
<p>
  PS: I don't want to diminish the tremendous effort it takes to create
  a framework and release it, but please go the extra mile and provide
  some concrete CRUD examples for a single class!
</p>
